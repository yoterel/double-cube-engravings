# Double Cube Engravings
This script creates a dataset for multi-label mesh clasification, with an intentionally difficult setup for point cloud classification (by sampling / using mesh vertices).

Based on the [MeshCNN](https://ranahanocka.github.io/MeshCNN/) Cube Engravings dataset.

This code was created based on scripts provided by Amir Hertz (original author of MeshCNN)

The .zip file contains a 4k examples generated dataset where each cube was engraved with 2 (not necessarily different) classes.
